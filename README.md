# BreakYourLLM

**BreakYourLLM** is a Next.js project focused on stress-testing language models (LLMs). It includes several pages that allow users to explore test results, view previous runs, and interact with the system. The goal is to demonstrate how LLM output can be evaluated, tested, and displayed in a structured, user-friendly UI.

## Responsive Design

All pages and components are designed to be **fully responsive**. On mobile devices, the layout adapts and remains easy to navigate. We will also include multiple screenshots of how the UI looks in **phone mode** (e.g., iPhone, Android) so users can see it in action:
- **Mobile-friendly** layout with collapsible menus

Stay tuned for updates with more **phone mode** images under this section.
